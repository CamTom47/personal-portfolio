				New to the world of Software Engineering with over a year's worth of experience, but not new to the world of
				solving problems. With my previous background being in the construction industry, I'm very accustom to providing
				unique solutions to unique problems. This, coupled with my new technical skills allow me the great opportunity
				to develop with a customer centric mindset and can do focus. I have experience in both backend, frontend, and
				full stack developement. Outside of professional life, my passions and hobbies vary by the day! I'm an avid love
				of the outdoors and welcome any opportunity to go on an adventure.
